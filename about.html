        <h2>From ATAC to Praxis: Four Years of Transformation</h2>
        <p>In August 2020, five directly impacted Arizonans filed corporate papers to create Arizonans for Transparency and Accountability in Corrections (ATAC). Co-founder John Fabricius had just spent 15 years across nine ADCRR complexes and watched his older brother die of an overdose after being denied treatment. Jessica Johnson brought eight years of experience from Perryville Prison. J Alexandria Hunt-Garcia contributed policy expertise and digital organizing skill. With no funding, no political connections, and no template to follow in Arizona, they began filing public records requests, building a volunteer network, and tracking every death, assault, and policy failure.</p>
        <p>For four years, ATAC operated as a volunteer-powered machine. We published quarterly "Death in Custody" reports that legislators couldn't ignore. We organized families who hadn't heard from loved ones during lockdowns. We partnered with journalism students to analyze ADCRR's own data, revealing systemic medical neglect. By 2023, ATAC had become a respected—if feared—voice at the Capitol, known for showing up prepared, speaking truth, and never backing down. Federal litigation (Jensen v. Shinn) confirmed ADCRR's constitutional violations, validating our work.</p>
        <p>The 2025 legislative session changed everything. After years of exposing retaliation against incarcerated whistleblowers and medical neglect that cost lives, bipartisan momentum shifted. Senate Bill 1507 created the Office of Independent Correctional Ombudsman, mandating unannounced inspections, subpoena power, and a citizen board with mandatory seats for directly impacted individuals. When Governor Katie Hobbs signed it into law, ATAC's founders knew their original mission was complete—and it was time to expand.</p>

        <h2>Rebirth as Praxis Initiative</h2>
        <p>At our 2024 strategic retreat, the board made a unanimous decision: evolve from a single-issue watchdog into a comprehensive justice organization. We chose the name Praxis Initiative because "praxis" means turning theory into action—the essence of credible messenger advocacy. This rebrand wasn't about abandoning our roots; it was about applying our proven model to the entire criminal legal system while maintaining our oversight work.</p>
        <p>Today, Praxis Initiative operates five programs. We continue monitoring the new Ombudsman's Office through our <strong>Independent Prison Oversight</strong> program, ensuring it fulfills its mandate. Our <strong>Criminal Legal System Reform</strong> and <strong>Drug Policy & Overdose Prevention</strong> programs tackle pre-trial detention, sentencing, and overdose crisis response. <strong>Core Civics & Advocacy Training</strong> and <strong>ARTS in Prison & Think Motion</strong> develop the next generation of directly impacted leaders. Our staff has grown from 5 volunteers to 15 paid employees, 100% of whom have lived experience.</p>

        <h2>Directly Impacted Leadership: Our Non-Negotiable</h2>
        <p>Praxis Initiative is one of the few Arizona nonprofits where lived experience isn't just represented—it's required. Every programmatic decision is made by people who have been incarcerated, deported, or directly impacted by the system. Our Executive Director spent 15 years in ADCRR custody. Our Policy Directors navigated the system as women and youth. This isn't tokenism; it's expertise.</p>
        <p>This structure gives us unmatched credibility. When we testify about prison conditions, we reference specific yards and units. When we draft legislation, we anticipate unintended consequences because we've lived them. When we train returning citizens to advocate, we teach not just the "how" but the "why"—the emotional resilience required to tell your story in a room of skeptical lawmakers. Our leadership model transforms personal trauma into political power.</p>
        <p>Our commitment extends to governance. Our board is majority directly impacted, with mandatory seats for currently incarcerated individuals (voting by proxy). We pay all returning citizen interns and prioritize hiring from communities most affected by Arizona's carceral policies. In 2024, the majority of our budget went directly to formerly incarcerated Arizonans as salary, stipends, or artist fees.</p>
