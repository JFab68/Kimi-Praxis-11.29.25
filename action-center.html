        pWe've made advocacy effortless with ready-to-send letters for Arizona officials. Our strongIndependent Prison Oversightstrong template demands full funding for the new Ombudsman's Office. The strongDrug Policystrong template calls for expanding Good Samaritan laws to protect 911 callers during overdoses. The strongProbation Reformstrong template urges legislators to cap probation terms. Each template is customizable; just add your story. We've seen 300 letters generate legislative meetings; 1,000 letters move bills to committee.p
        pFor media advocacy, use our Op-Ed template to pitch local papers. We've had opinion pieces published using this framework, focusing on personal narrative + data + clear ask. The strongCore Civics & Advocacy Trainingstrong team reviews drafts if you email them through our contact form.p
        pAll templates are available in English and Spanish, with plain-language instructions. Print versions are distributed weekly at community centers in Maryvale, Guadalupe, and South Tucson.p

        h2Volunteer Roles Join Our Teamsh2
        pWe need volunteer prison oversight monitors to accompany our staff on facility inspections. This role requires a 6-month commitment, background clearance, and completion of our 16-hour training (provided free). Monitors visit facilities quarterly, document conditions, and write public reports. Currently, 12 volunteers support this work; we need 30 to cover all 13 state prisons.p
        pOur strongDrug Policy & Overdose Preventionstrong program seeks peer outreach volunteers in Maricopa, Pima, and Coconino counties. You'll distribute naloxone and harm reduction supplies, connect people to treatment, and report policy barriers. This is boots-on-the-ground work requiring cultural humility and commitment to non-judgment. We provide training, supplies, and a $200 monthly stipend.p
