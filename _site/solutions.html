        <h2>Independent Prison Oversight: Watching the Watchers</h2>
        <p>Now that Arizona has an Office of Independent Correctional Ombudsman, our work is just beginning. Our <strong>Independent Prison Oversight</strong> program trains directly impacted auditors to conduct parallel inspections of ADCRR facilities, ensuring the state office doesn't become a rubber stamp. We've developed an inspection framework covering medical care, use of force, grievance procedures, and conditions of confinement. In 2025, we identified facilities where the state oversight process missed critical suicide prevention failures.</p>
        <p>This program serves as rapid response. When incarcerated people report retaliation for filing grievances, our team—working with pro bono attorneys—files emergency motions, contacts oversight officials directly, and publicizes abuse within 24 hours. We're building a hotline connecting people inside directly to our advocates, bypassing ADCRR's monitored systems. This is oversight with teeth, powered by those who know every prison corner.</p>
        <p>Our goal is embedding community voice into state structures. We advocate for the Ombudsman's Office to hire majority directly impacted staff and publish findings in plain language, not bureaucratic jargon. SB 1507 gave us the skeleton; Praxis Initiative is building the muscle and nerve.</p>

        <h2>Criminal Legal System Reform & Drug Policy: Rewriting the Rules</h2>
        <p>Our <strong>Criminal Legal System Reform</strong> program operates a full-service legislative advocacy shop at the Arizona Capitol. During the 2025 session, we co-sponsored SB 1507 establishing independent oversight. We also championed bills ending mandatory minimums for drug possession, creating "second look" sentencing review for juveniles sentenced as adults, limiting probation terms, expanding compassionate release for elderly incarcerated people, and requiring prosecutors to disclose racial impact data on plea deals.</p>
        <p>Simultaneously, our <strong>Drug Policy & Overdose Prevention</strong> program addresses Arizona's fatal overdose epidemic. We distribute naloxone to returning citizens and families, train incarcerated people in overdose response for post-release preparedness, and lobby for harm reduction policies. Our peer-led "Harm Reduction in the Hood" program operates in Maryvale and South Tucson, offering wound care, fentanyl test strips, and connections to treatment without law enforcement involvement. Both programs share a core belief: punishment worsens substance use; community support saves lives.</p>

        <h2>Core Civics & ARTS in Prison: Developing Leaders</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Core Civics & Advocacy Training for Returning Citizens</strong> program is our leadership pipeline. Over 12 weeks, cohort members learn legislative process, media relations, public speaking, and campaign strategy. We provide stipends, childcare, and transportation because economic barriers shouldn't prevent participation. Graduates have testified 47 times before legislative committees, secured seats on the Governor's Reentry Taskforce, and launched grassroots organizations. This is how we transfer power to the next generation.</p>
        <p>Our <strong>ARTS in Prison & Think Motion</strong> program operates in multiple ADCRR facilities, serving incarcerated artists annually. Teaching artists—most formerly incarcerated—lead workshops in music, visual arts, dance, and movement. The work produced is stunning: last year's "Perryville Poetry Project" anthology sold copies with proceeds split between artists' families and our reentry fund. Beyond expression, these classes build analytical thinking, emotional regulation, and public voice—skills that translate directly to effective advocacy upon release.</p>
        <p>Together, these programs create a closed loop: art inside builds voice, training outside builds power, and both feed into our policy and oversight work. Every program amplifies the others. We're currently planning a 2026 exhibition, "Visions from Inside," featuring 50 visual artists at the ASU Art Museum.</p>
