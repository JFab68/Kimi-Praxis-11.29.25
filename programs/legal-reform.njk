          <h2>Our Approach</h2>
          <p>We draft, promote, and advocate for evidence-based criminal justice reforms that reduce mass incarceration, improve public safety, and ensure equal treatment under the law. Our policy strategies are informed by firsthand lived experience and backed by rigorous research.</p>
          
          <p>Our work combines rigorous policy research, legislative advocacy, community engagement, and public education. We build coalitions across ideological lines—from Right on Crime to Dream.org—because transparency and accountability transcend politics.</p>
          
          <h2>Key Legislative Initiatives</h2>
          <h3>Home Confinement & Electronic Monitoring</h3>
          <p>We've championed legislation to allow low-level offenders with clean disciplinary records to transition to home confinement with electronic monitoring. This evidence-based reform:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reduces prison overcrowding and costs</li>
            <li>Preserves public safety through supervised release</li>
            <li>Projected savings: up to $90 million annually within five years</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><em>2024 Bill:</em> Sponsored by Rep. Kevin Payne (R-Peoria), passed House committees but stalled in Senate. We're refining the approach for 2025.</p>

          <h2>Access to Courts & Legal Redress</h2>
          <p>Arizona's prison system creates significant barriers for incarcerated individuals seeking legal recourse. Our comprehensive analysis identifies systemic impediments including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Inadequate law library access and legal materials</li>
            <li>Restrictions on outside legal assistance</li>
            <li>Communication barriers with attorneys</li>
            <li>Retaliation against individuals who file grievances</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>We're drafting legislation to guarantee meaningful access to courts and strengthen the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) compliance.</p>
          
          <h2>Reentry & Second Chances</h2>
          <p>Successful reentry is critical to reducing recidivism and strengthening communities. Our policy work focuses on:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Certificate of Second Chance expansion</li>
            <li>Occupational licensing reform for returning citizens</li>
            <li>Automatic record sealing for eligible offenses</li>
            <li>Transportation and ID access programs</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h2>Coalition Building</h2>
          <p>We partner with diverse organizations to build bipartisan consensus:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Right on Crime</strong> - Conservative reform advocacy</li>
            <li><strong>Dream.org</strong> - Progressive justice reform</li>
            <li><strong>Arizona Justice Project</strong> - Wrongful conviction advocacy</li>
