          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>As Arizona's only directly impacted-led organization dedicated to independent prison oversight, we monitor conditions within the Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Reentry (ADCRR), investigate complaints, and advocate for systemic reforms that protect the health, safety, and dignity of incarcerated individuals.</p>
          
          <p>Born from our origins as Arizonans for Transparency and Accountability in Corrections (ATAC), this program represents our founding commitment to ensuring that what happens behind prison walls does not stay hidden from public view.</p>
          
          <h2>Why Oversight Matters</h2>
          <p>Arizona's prison system has faced decades of litigation over inadequate medical and mental health care, unconstitutional conditions, and systemic neglect. For years, ADCRR maintained "total narrative control," making it nearly impossible for lawmakers, journalists, and even prison administrators to understand the full scope of problems inside.</p>
          
          <p>Our co-founder John Fabricius witnessed this firsthand during his 15 years of incarceration: "I watched people die. I watched a guy lose a leg. I watched my friend go blind after waiting three months for an outside appointment and nine months for surgery—for a detached retina that prison medical staff treated with Visine."</p>

          <h2>Our Impact & Advocacy</h2>
          <p><strong>Legislative Victory:</strong> After years of persistent advocacy, Senate Bill 1507 was signed into law in 2025, creating Arizona's first Independent Correctional Oversight Office. This bipartisan victory came after:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Four years of drafting legislation and building coalitions</li>
            <li>Testifying before legislative committees</li>
            <li>Partnering with Justice Action Network, FAMM, and Dream.org</li>
            <li>Generating overwhelming bipartisan support (23-5 Senate, 46-10 House)</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><strong>Funding Challenge:</strong> While the office was authorized, its $1.5 million appropriation was stripped from the budget. We're now working to secure funding through federal grants, private contributions, and next year's legislative session.</p>
          
          <h2>Current Work</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Monitoring implementation of the new Oversight Office</li>
            <li>Investigating complaints from incarcerated individuals and families</li>
            <li>Documenting conditions through facility visits and data analysis</li>
            <li>Advocating for transparency in ADCRR operations</li>
            <li>Building bipartisan support for adequate funding</li>
          </ul>
