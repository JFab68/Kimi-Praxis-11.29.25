        <h2>Arizona's Directly Impacted Voice for Reform</h2>
        <p>We are Praxis Initiative, Arizona's only 100% directly impacted criminal justice reform organization. Born from lived experience of incarceration, probation, and court involvement, our organization began in August 2020 as Arizonans for Transparency and Accountability in Corrections (ATAC). Every staff member, board director, and core volunteer has directly navigated Arizona's criminal legal system, giving us unmatched understanding of what reform actually requires.</p>
        <p>For four years, ATAC led the statewide campaign to create independent oversight of the Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation & Reentry (ADCRR). In 2025, that vision became reality when the Arizona Legislature passed Senate Bill 1507, establishing the Office of Independent Correctional Ombudsman. This historic victory proved that directly impacted leadership can move mountains—literally reshaping state government to be more accountable to its people. The bill passed with bipartisan support from Sen. Shawnna Bolick (R) and Sen. Analise Ortiz (D).</p>
        <p>With that milestone achieved, we expanded our mission. In 2024, ATAC evolved into Praxis Initiative, broadening our work beyond prison walls to address every stage of the criminal legal system while maintaining our fierce commitment to oversight. Our team now operates five distinct programs, all led by people who've lived the problems we're solving.</p>

        <h2>Five Programs, One Mission</h2>
        <p>Praxis Initiative runs five interconnected programs that attack injustice at its roots. Our <strong>Independent Prison Oversight</strong> program monitors the new state oversight office while training formerly incarcerated auditors to conduct independent facility inspections. <strong>Criminal Legal System Reform</strong> targets sentencing laws, probation terms, and collateral consequences through direct legislative advocacy. <strong>Drug Policy & Overdose Prevention</strong> confronts Arizona's overdose crisis by pushing for harm reduction, treatment access, and ending prosecution-driven responses to substance use.</p>
        <p>Through <strong>Core Civics & Advocacy Training for Returning Citizens</strong>, we equip directly impacted individuals with tools to testify at the legislature, serve on state commissions, and lead community organizing. Our <strong>ARTS in Prison & Think Motion</strong> sends teaching artists into ADCRR facilities to facilitate music, visual arts, dance, and movement workshops that affirm humanity behind bars and build skills for post-release advocacy. Together, these programs create a pipeline from personal transformation to systemic change.</p>

        <h2>Real Reform Happens Here</h2>
        <p>In Arizona, mass incarceration isn't distant—it's a daily crisis. ADCRR's annual budget tops $1.77 billion, yet the agency spent $30 million defending constitutional violations and $2.4 million in contempt fines for ignoring court orders. Over 33,000 people have been incarcerated into known Eighth Amendment violations since June 2022. Praxis Initiative addresses this urgency by combining credible messenger advocacy with rigorous policy research. When we testify at the Capitol, legislators listen because we've lived on the yards where these policies play out.</p>
        <p>Our bipartisan approach sets us apart. We work across party lines because caging human beings isn't partisan—it's moral. In 2025, we co-sponsored SB 1507 with Justice Action Network, CPAC's Nolan Center for Justice, and FAMM, earning support from both progressive Democrats and conservative Republicans. This is the Praxis model: find common ground where freedom expands, hold firm where dignity is non-negotiable.</p>
        <p>The results speak volumes. Since 2020, our advocacy impacted dozens of legislative proposals, trained hundreds of returning citizens as advocates, and established the first independent prison oversight body in Arizona's 57-year history. But we measure success in human terms: the mother who can visit her son without arbitrary visitation denials, the artist who publishes poetry from Perryville Prison, the advocate who now chairs a state commission.</p>
