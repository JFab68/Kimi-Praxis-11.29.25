I need to create a website for the pal group that's POWEL representative Powell the group that is working on criminal legal system reforms and ancillary laws I preserved a domain a fair FAIR AZ 2027 dot org as the domain and I wanna set up just a very simple website umm I wanted to have an outward facing public facing landing page that's got you know a few sections on it generalized information and nice hero section looks nice it just gives general information about the group and you know the ability to sign up if you're interested in talking about this bipartisan nature and the fact that there's all kinds of stakeholders at the table we have you know citizens and directly impacted people we've got mental health professionals we've got attorneys we've got organizations we've got prosecutors and law enforcement and judges and everybody is on in this list it's a excellent dynamic robust group that is working collectively across all ideological lines to arrive at necessary solutions real real solutions evidence based solutions for some of our most seemingly Intractable problems in our criminal legal system here in Arizona and penal system. New one so I wanna have you know that basic information facing outwards and in addition to that you know ability vehicles for people to you know send a message into the group or or you know to us at the administration or sign up to to volunteer to be in one of these groups and then be able to sign up into the subgroups subcommittees but then the rest of the website I I that's it for the public facing part of it is that and some general information whatever head or footer that type of thing but really what I wanted to be primarily is I wanted to be a for the committee members and so members only access for resources and you know we can publicize the calendar there and you know our internal calendar we can publicize the resources and information there on web pages that they can access only through their we'll give him a you know unique ID create database and give me unique ID and so yeah 'cause I want to be a Resource Center and I want to do it that way and also the roster for people and like phone numbers and stuff like that so I want it to be safe and secure and all that stuff and only accessible by you know as needed so not everybody needs to succeed phone numbers only committee chairs and vice chairs and administration needs to see anybody phone number or e-mail address but you know the rest of the weekend you know I want to organize and all this stuff. And we have 6 subcommittee so we'll probably have 6 pages and then on each one of those pages will have resources and information and references and all that kind of stuff so that's probably what we'll do is have you know a public facing landing page a internally facing landing page and then a general resources and information page and then the six subcommittee pages with individualized references and resources and there will be umm gradations of access and control uh administrative level umm which super user manager level which is gonna be chairs and vice chairs and then member level which is gonna have the least privileges it can be simple straightforward doesn't have to be super dynamic or whatever static just that needs to be functional it needs to be secure and it needs to work.
