        <h2>Letter Templates: Contact Power in 5 Minutes</h2>
        <p>We've made advocacy effortless with ready-to-send letters for Arizona officials. Our <strong>Independent Prison Oversight</strong> template demands full funding for the new Ombudsman's Office. The <strong>Drug Policy</strong> template calls for expanding Good Samaritan laws to protect 911 callers during overdoses. The <strong>Probation Reform</strong> template urges legislators to cap probation terms. Each template is customizable; just add your story. We've seen 300 letters generate legislative meetings; 1,000 letters move bills to committee.</p>
        <p>For media advocacy, use our Op-Ed template to pitch local papers. We've had opinion pieces published using this framework, focusing on personal narrative + data + clear ask. The <strong>Core Civics & Advocacy Training</strong> team reviews drafts if you email them through our contact form.</p>
        <p>All templates are available in English and Spanish, with plain-language instructions. Print versions are distributed weekly at community centers in Maryvale, Guadalupe, and South Tucson.</p>

        <h2>Volunteer Roles: Join Our Teams</h2>
        <p>We need volunteer prison oversight monitors to accompany our staff on facility inspections. This role requires a 6-month commitment, background clearance, and completion of our 16-hour training (provided free). Monitors visit facilities quarterly, document conditions, and write public reports. Currently, 12 volunteers support this work; we need 30 to cover all 13 state prisons.</p>
        <p>Our <strong>Drug Policy & Overdose Prevention</strong> program seeks peer outreach volunteers in Maricopa, Pima, and Coconino counties. You'll distribute naloxone and harm reduction supplies, connect people to treatment, and report policy barriers. This is boots-on-the-ground work requiring cultural humility and commitment to non-judgment. We provide training, supplies, and a $200 monthly stipend.</p>
