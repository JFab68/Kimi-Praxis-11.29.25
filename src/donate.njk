        <h2>Where Your Money Goes: The Five Programs</h2>
        <p>Your donation directly funds Arizona's only directly impacted justice organization. A gift of <strong>$50</strong> provides art supplies for a month of <strong>ARTS in Prison & Think Motion</strong> inside Perryville. <strong>$100</strong> trains three returning citizens in overdose response through our <strong>Drug Policy & Overdose Prevention</strong> program. <strong>$250</strong> covers a stipend for one participant in <strong>Core Civics & Advocacy Training</strong>, ensuring economic barriers don't silence directly impacted voices.</p>
        <p><strong>$500</strong> funds a single prison oversight inspection by our <strong>Independent Prison Oversight</strong> team, including travel to remote facilities like ASPC-Winslow, staff time, and report publication. These inspections expose medical neglect and prevent retaliation. <strong>$1,000</strong> supports a month of direct lobbying for our <strong>Criminal Legal System Reform</strong> program, covering policy research that led to SB 1507 and probation reform efforts.</p>
        <p>We maintain an 85% program-to-administration cost ratio. That means 85 cents of every dollar goes directly to programs, not overhead. We publish quarterly financial reports showing exactly how funds are spent, because transparency starts with us.</p>

        <h2>Impact: What Your Gift Achieves</h2>
        <p>In 2024, ATAC's lean budget helped build the coalition that passed SB 1507—a reform impacting 40,000 incarcerated Arizonans. In 2025, with expanded funding, Praxis Initiative runs five programs and will train 75 returning citizen advocates. Your donation scales this impact. <strong>Monthly donors</strong> provide predictable funding that lets us hire directly impacted staff, plan multi-year campaigns, and guarantee stipends for every training cohort.</p>
        <p>Major gifts ($5,000+) fund strategic expansion. A recent $10,000 donation allowed us to expand <strong>ARTS in Prison & Think Motion</strong> to ASPC-Tucson. Corporate sponsorships ($25,000+) underwrite our advocacy days and training programs. Legacy gifts ensure Arizona always has a directly impacted voice at the table. Whatever the size, your donation seeds power in communities historically denied it.</p>
