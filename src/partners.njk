        <h2>Community & Advocacy Partners</h2>
        <p>Praxis Initiative anchors the Arizona Justice Reform Coalition (AJRC), a table of organizations including ACLU of Arizona, Mass Liberation AZ, Arizona Faith Network, and the NAACP Maricopa County Branch. Together, we coordinate legislative strategy, share resources, and ensure directly impacted voices lead every campaign. In 2025, AJRC pooled resources to support SB 1507, amplifying our collective power at the Capitol. Our <strong>Criminal Legal System Reform</strong> program coordinates AJRC's legislative priorities.</p>
        <p>Our <strong>Drug Policy & Overdose Prevention</strong> program partners with Sonoran Prevention Works, Shot in the Dark, and Indigenous Roots Phoenix to provide peer-led harm reduction. These partnerships enable us to distribute 5,000+ naloxone kits annually and respond to overdose clusters within hours. We co-sponsor "Surviving Overdose" support groups for family members, led by bilingual staff.</p>
        <p>Indigenous justice is central to our work. We partner with Native-led organizations like Indigenous Peoples Justice and the Navajo Nation Human Rights Commission to address Native over-incarceration. Native people are 5.3% of Arizona's population but 13% of ADCRR custody. Our joint campaigns focus on tribal jurisdiction, cultural programming inside prisons, and post-release reconnection to tribal communities.</p>

        <h2>Legal & Oversight Partners</h2>
        <p>Our <strong>Independent Prison Oversight</strong> program collaborates with Arizona Capital Representation Project and the Federal Public Defender to monitor ADCRR's constitutional compliance. These attorneys provide pro bono support when we file emergency motions or interpret complex regulations. We've partnered with the University of Arizona School of Law to create a Prison Law Clinic where students assist with grievance analysis.</p>
        <p>For <strong>Core Civics & Advocacy Training</strong>, we partner with Arizona Advocacy Network and Local First Arizona to teach campaign finance law and small business development for returning citizen entrepreneurs. These partnerships ensure our graduates have political and economic power. We also work with the Phoenix Suns and Mercury on "Fair Chance Hiring" initiatives.</p>

        <h2>Cultural & Institutional Partners</h2>
        <p>Our <strong>ARTS in Prison & Think Motion</strong> program thrives through collaboration with Phoenix Art Museum, Arizona Humanities, and the Poetry Center at University of Arizona. These partnerships bring professional artists into facilities and exhibit incarcerated work publicly. The "Perryville Poetry Project" was co-published with University of Arizona Press, giving statewide bookstore distribution. We're planning a 2026 exhibition, "Visions from Inside," featuring visual artists at ASU Art Museum.</p>
        <p>Academic partnerships strengthen our credibility. We work with Arizona State University's School of Criminology to evaluate outcomes and Northern Arizona University to track recidivism among <strong>Core Civics & Advocacy Training</strong> graduates. These data partnerships ensure our work is evidence-based and impact is measurable.</p>
        <p>Faith communities provide essential support. We partner with Tempe First United Methodist, St. Mary's Basilica, and Islamic Center of North Phoenix to host reentry supply drives, provide meeting space, and mobilize congregants for legislative action. Their moral voice amplifies our policy demands.</p>
