        <h2>Police: The First Point of Failure</h2>
        <p>Arizona's law enforcement agencies operate with minimal transparency and maximal militarization. Phoenix Police Department leads the nation in officer-involved shootings, while smaller departments often have no civilian review boards. Our <strong>Criminal Legal System Reform</strong> program documented how "pretextual stops" disproportionately target Black and Latino drivers on Interstate 10 and Loop 202. These stops generate thousands of felony arrests that begin with minor violations.</p>
        <p>The problems extend to policing inside prisons. ADCRR's internal investigations classify 98% of use-of-force incidents as "justified" without external review. Our <strong>Independent Prison Oversight</strong> program exposed how officers who assault incarcerated people rarely face discipline, often receiving promotions instead. This culture of unaccountability begins with street policing and hardens inside prison walls.</p>
        <p>Police power structures also include AZPOST, which decertifies fewer than 1% of officers despite thousands of misconduct complaints. We've testified annually to expand AZPOST's authority and require public disclosure of officer misconduct files, facing fierce opposition from police unions at every turn.</p>

        <h2>Pre-Trial & Prosecution: The Revolving Door of Injustice</h2>
        <p>Arizona's pre-trial system criminalizes poverty. County attorneys routinely request cash bail amounts 50% higher than national averages, leaving low-income people—disproportionately Black and Indigenous—jailed for weeks awaiting trial. Our <strong>Drug Policy & Overdose Prevention</strong> program documented cases of individuals detained for simple possession unable to afford $500 bail, losing jobs, housing, and custody while presumed innocent. We campaign to end cash bail for non-violent offenses.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors wield extraordinary power with zero accountability. County attorneys set policy through charging decisions that never face public review. Arizona's superior court system concentrates power in elected prosecutors who face voters only every four years. Our legislative advocacy focuses on requiring prosecutorial data transparency—tracking plea deal rates, charging disparities by race—while our <strong>Core Civics & Advocacy Training</strong> prepares community members to serve on prosecutorial review commissions.</p>

        <h2>Probation, Prison & Post-Release: The Long Tail of Punishment</h2>
        <p>Once sentenced, Arizonans face a labyrinth of punitive supervision. Our <strong>Criminal Legal System Reform</strong> program revealed that technical probation violations—missing a meeting, failing a drug test—account for 35% of prison admissions. Private probation companies profit from monthly fees that push people deeper into debt. We champion probation term limits and presumption of early termination for compliance.</p>
        <p>Inside ADCRR facilities, the crisis is acute. Overcrowding exceeds design capacity while medical care delays result in preventable deaths. Solitary confinement operates without external monitoring. Our <strong>Independent Prison Oversight</strong> work confirms these failures. The <strong>ARTS in Prison & Think Motion</strong> program provides a lifeline, but cannot fix systemic abuse. We need the Ombudsman's Office fully funded and fiercely independent.</p>
        <p>Post-release barriers create permanent second-class citizenship. Arizona denies voting rights to over 200,000 residents with felony convictions. Occupational licensing boards reject applicants with records for most healthcare, education, and trades jobs. Our <strong>Core Civics & Advocacy Training</strong> helps returning citizens navigate these barriers while advocating for automatic rights restoration and "ban the box" expansion.</p>

        <h2>Power: Who Controls Narrative & Purse</h2>
        <p>The final "P" is Power—corporate donors, private prison lobbyists, and tough-on-crime politicians shaping Arizona's system. GEO Group and CoreCivic still operate facilities in Eloy and Florence. Our <strong>Core Civics & Advocacy Training</strong> teaches community members to follow the money, testify at budget hearings, and challenge the narrative that safety requires caging. Real reform means shifting power back to impacted communities.</p>
