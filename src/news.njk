        <h2>Spring 2025: SB 1507 Signed, Oversight Office Launches</h2>
        <p>On March 21, 2025, Governor Katie Hobbs signed SB 1507, establishing the Office of Independent Correctional Ombudsman. The bill, prime-sponsored by Sen. Shawnna Bolick (R-District 20) with support from Sen. Analise Ortiz (D-District 24), creates an autonomous oversight body with investigation authority, record access, and facility inspection powers. Our <strong>Independent Prison Oversight</strong> team provided key testimony and will publish its first parallel inspection report in June, focusing on ASPC-Perryville with interviews from 50 incarcerated women.</p>
        <p>In legislative news, our coalition's work during the ADCRR Sunset Review prevented the agency from obscuring constitutional violations. Despite ADCRR's $1.77 billion budget and $30 million spent on private legal defense, federal courts have held them accountable for violating Eighth Amendment rights. Our <strong>Criminal Legal System Reform</strong> team continues pushing for probation reform and sentencing reform in the 2026 session.</p>
        <p>Our <strong>ARTS in Prison & Think Motion</strong> program received national attention for its peer-led workshops. The program currently operates in multiple facilities, with teaching artists—most formerly incarcerated—facilitating music, visual arts, and movement classes that build skills for post-release advocacy.</p>

        <h2>Returning Citizens Lead the Charge</h2>
        <p>Three Praxis <strong>Core Civics & Advocacy Training</strong> graduates have taken leadership roles in state policy discussions. Training participants have testified 47 times before legislative committees, secured seats on the Governor's Reentry Taskforce, and launched grassroots organizations. Our model proves that directly impacted leadership changes outcomes.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Drug Policy & Overdose Prevention</strong> team distributed 2,000 naloxone kits in Q1 2025 through community partners in Maryvale and South Tucson. We documented 47 overdose reversals and connected 89 people to treatment. Our latest report, "Harm Reduction in the Hood: Year One Data," shows peer-led outreach is three times more effective than traditional referral services.</p>
